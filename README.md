# Practice01 Project

This project is based on the GW project, with several modifications and additions.

## Introduction

Basically, this project is just for running locally, aimed at maintaining my coding skills. It's a web crawler that combines output to files for an existing app I have for reading novels. 

The process involves using URLConnection to fetch JSON data, then analyzing HTML and outputting to a txt file, which has been proven to work. 

Currently, I'm working on organizing the entire project and sorting all the code into various models, utilities, and processing classes.

## Modifications

- Removed business logic.
- Retained Oracle database connection.
- Retained daemon timer schedule.
- Retained Jersey RESTful API.

## Additions

- Organized and renamed some local folders.
- Conducted testing with different JSON jars.
- Started work on a web crawler (currently incomplete).
